# data_science_data_preprocessing
The provided code performs several essential data preprocessing steps necessary for preparing data for machine learning models.
Data Loading: Read the dataset.
Feature Extraction: Extract features and target variables.
Missing Data Handling: Impute missing values with the mean.
Categorical Encoding: Convert categorical variables to numerical values using Label Encoding and One-Hot Encoding.
Target Encoding: Convert target variable to numerical values.
Data Splitting: Split data into training and testing sets.
Feature Scaling: Standardize feature values.
These preprocessing steps ensure that the data is cleaned, encoded, and scaled properly, making it suitable for machine learning algorithms.
